    <p> The school Satang Jabang, based in the village Kafountine, Casamance.
        Satang Jabang aims to help woman of the ages 15 to 25 by giving them lessons on how
        to cook and sew. These lessons will be taught in a course of three years.
        Other subjects include: IT, leadership and basic health. There are lessons
        for those who didn't attend primary school, where they will learn reading and writing.
        This counts for 40% of the 80 students (48 students).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The leadership of three people, who have worked as a team, created an union with the
        Dutch foundation which was founded in 1996, to finance the school. The school
        gets 400.000 swedish krona ($47.761/&euro;41.070) a year. That is enough to train 80-100 students
        and hire 13 teachers. The school became a part of the vocational education in 2005.
        Yet the school doesn't get funds from the goverment and can't go on without the
        support of foreign countries. The school is 20% self-sufficient via internet-cafes,
        clothing stores and a botanic garden.

    <h1>Our goals</h1>
    <p>
        Satang Jabang wants to offer a second chance to young women by preparing them for
        careers, like preparing and conserving food, designing clothes and poultry farming.
        The school wants the students to be ready to start a company on their own. The school
        is against the conservative vision against women.
